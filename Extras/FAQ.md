# FAQ

### Can you print me a copy?

Currently no, but its something we are working towards!

### What happens when I try to execute a manoeuvre but my opponents plane token is in the way?

If you can't execute a manoeuvre without finishing it in the same place as an opponent, you can't choose that manoeuvre.

However, if you need to move an opponent's token out of the way so you can put the manoeuvre template down you can move the other players token, but use an altitude token next to where the moved token was to make sure you don't forget where it was originally.

### My opponent just rolled three 6s on the attack dice, what can I do?

Hope you have enough Health left and roll very well, that pilot has good aim!

### The rules for Split S say I can't execute it on the same turn as I gain altitude. Does this mean I can't do an Immelmann after a knockout?

No. The altitude gained from an Immelmann does not count, so you could do a Split S, then proceed to Immelmann during the attack stage after taking an opponent out!

Anyone who manages that... Well that's one hell of a pilot!

### Does a critical hit do more damage?

The benefit of a critical hit is it's difficult to dodge. Think of it as a very accurate shot. It still only counts as one!
