Squadron Leader is a fast pace World War 1 (loosely) themed aerial combat game that is easy to learn and quick to play, with multifaceted strategy built in that can be enjoyed by all ages!

The modular nature of the rules allows for players to customise their game and add entirely new layers of strategy.

We encourage the use of house rules, and ask that you make suggestions on the <a href="https://github.com/Wollivan/SquadronLeader" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, this is an Open Source game after all!
