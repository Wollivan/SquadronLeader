# Advanced Manoeuvres

For players already familiar with the core rules or those seeking to become world-famous fighter pilots, the following advanced manoeuvres provide additional tactical options:

**Note:** Manoeuvres that cost altitude cannot be performed in the same round that the player has gained altitude.

## Barrel Roll

This manoeuvre seperates the timid from the bold!

**Cost:** This is the only manoeuvre you can do this round

**Action:** Perfom a 3 cost manoeuvre but don't rotate your token afterwards

## Dive Bomb

Reward hyper-aggresive tactics with this risky manoeuvre!

**Requirement:** Perform an attack against a plane within range 1 that has less altitude

**Cost:** Reduce altitude to match defender

**Action:** Roll a d6:

- Result of 3-6: Deal one damage.
- Result of 1-2: Take one damage.

Not to be confused with Divebomb, the homicidal Decepticon.

## Immelmann

Few pilots ever pull this manoeuvre off.

**Requirement:** Eliminate opponent while you have no altitude tokens

**Action:** Gain 4 altitude, perform a straight manoeuvre and rotate plane 180Â°

## Push the Envelope

This manoeuvre rewards daring pilots who are willing to test the limits of the aircraft by going faster and higher than it should be possible!

A player may push the envelope during the manoeuvre stage and roll a d6:

**Requirement:** Execute during Manoeuvre stage, once per round

**Action:** Roll a d6:

- Result of 5-6: Gain 1 <img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/manoeuvrability.svg" width="12" style="display:inline-block"/> this round OR 1 extra altitude.
- Result of 1-4: Take one damage.

### More Info

All the manoeuvres are informed by real life actual plane stuff!

- [Barrel Roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_roll): "A barrel roll is an aerial manoeuvre in which an airplane makes a complete rotation on both its longitudinal and lateral axes, causing it to follow a helical path, approximately maintaining its original direction."

- [Dive Bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_bomber): "A dive bomber is a bomber aircraft that dives directly at its targets in order to provide greater accuracy for the bomb it drops. Diving towards the target simplifies the bomb's trajectory and allows the pilot to keep visual contact throughout the bomb run."

- [Immelmann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immelmann_turn): "In modern aerobatics, an Immelmann turn (also known as a roll-off-the-top, or simply an Immelmann) is an aerobatic manoeuvre that results in level flight in the opposite direction at a higher altitude."

- [Push the Envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_envelope#%22Pushing_the_envelope%22): "The flight envelope is a graph visualizing the capabilities of the aircraft in terms of min-max speeds and the altitude at which it can safely fly. The envelope itself is of course defined by various parameters and there is absolutely no way of simulating that in a board game. But, there is a term "Pushing the envelope", which means that the pilot tries to go over the speed or altitude defined by the flight envelope while risking the integrity of the aircraft (or causing the plane to stall)."

- [Split S](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_S): "To execute a split S, the pilot half-rolls their aircraft inverted and executes a descending half-loop, resulting in level flight in the opposite direction at a lower altitude."
