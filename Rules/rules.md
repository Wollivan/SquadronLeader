# Rules

The objective of the game is to be the last plane left in the air by reducing your opponents Health to zero.

Each pilot will need:

- 1 plane token
- 4 altitude tokens

The pilots will share:

- 1 move template
- 1 range ruler
- 4 Red d6 for the Attack dice
- 4 Green d6 for the Defense dice

The playing area of the game can be any size. Its usually just the entire table but if you want to have a consistent size try 3 lengths of the range ruler.

At the start of the game each player assigns their choice from 4, 3, 3, 2 to their:

- Health
- Defense
- Attack
- Manoeuvrability

A good starting setup for new players is:

- Health - 3
- Defense - 3
- Attack - 2
- Manoeuvrability - 4

The last player who saw a plane in real life goes first.

Each player places their plane on the playing area in turn.
It should be placed within range 1 of the edge of the playing area, and no closer than the ranger ruler to another player.

There are 2 stages each round, the manoeuvre Stage and the Attack Stage.
Everyone moves their plane during the manoeuvre stage, and after that, everyone Attacks during the Attack Stage.
Here is how that works:

## Manoeuvre Stage:

- To move, place the manoeuvre template at the front of the plane token, and move the plane to the other end of the template.
- The player may use templates up to the value of their Manoeuvrability, for example a player with a Manoeuvrability of 4 can execute 2 straight manoeuvres & 1 bank manoeuvre (1 + 1 + 2).
- A player must complete at least one manoeuvre each round otherwise their plane would stall and they would plummet to the ground!
- If any part of a plane token goes off the board at the end of a manoeuvre, that plane is destroyed!

The below gif shows how to use the manoeuvre templates.

This gif shows a manoeuvre Stage where the player spends 3 Manoeuvrability to move around.

### Altitude

The sky is a big place. Let's take advantage of that!

- At the start of the game each player takes off with 0 altitude tokens.
- Once per round during their manoeuvre stage, a player may spend 1 Manoeuvrability to Climb and add 1 altitude token underneath their plane.
- Players can only gain 1 altitude per round.
- If a player hasn't Climbed this round, they may Dive by removing any number of altitude tokens to gain that much Manoeuvrability this round.
- The maximum altitude allowed is 4.

## Attack Stage:

- The attacker declares which enemy plane they will attack.
- A player can only attack if the enemy plane is within in range.
  - Use the range ruler, ensuring both planes are within that distance to each other.
- The defender must also be within the attackers firing arc which is shown with the 90° lines on the front of the token.
- The attacking player rolls a number of Attack dice equal to their Attack value.
- The defending player rolls a number of Defense dice equal to their Defense value.
- Each value of 4-6 rolled on the Attack dice counts as 1 damage. A 6 rolled counts as a critical hit.
- Each value of 4-6 rolled on the Defense dice counts as a dodge and cancels out a hit. It takes 2 dodges to cancel out a critical hit. Critical hits still only deal 1 damage when not cancelled out.
- The defender loses Health equal to the hits that haven’t been canceled out.

This image shows a situation where the white plane can shoot at the yellow plane (blue arc) and the yellow plane CAN'T shoot at the white plane (red arc).

Tip: use the box lid as a dice tray to avoid moving your plane tokens around by accident!

### Attack/Defense bonuses

- The defender may reroll 1 die if they are within the furthest section of the range ruler
- The attacker may reroll 1 dice if they are within the closest section of the range ruler
- If the defender is within the forward firing guies, the attacker may reroll 1 die
- An attcker with a greater altitude to the defender may reroll 1 die

If multiple abilities allow you to reroll a die, you can reroll that many dice, even if its the same dicebeing rolled multple times.

## Next Round:

After the last player who can attack is finished, a new round begins and the player who went second in the previous round now begins the next round.
