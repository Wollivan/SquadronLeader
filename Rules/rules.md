# Rules

**Objective:** Be the last plane in the air by reducing your opponents' Health to zero.

## Setup:

Each player needs:

- 1 plane token
- 4 altitude tokens

Shared items:

- 1 move template
- 1 range ruler
- 4 Red d6 for Attack dice
- 4 Green d6 for Defense dice

### Playing Area:

The playing area can be any size, typically the entire table. For a consistent size, try 3 lengths of the range ruler.

### Starting Assignments:

At the beginning of the game, each player assigns values from 4, 3, 3, 2 to the following attributes:

<img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/health.svg" width="12" style="display:inline-block"/> - Health

<img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/defense.svg" width="11.5" style="display:inline-block"/> - Defense

<img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/attack.svg" width="14" style="display:inline-block"/> - Attack

<img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/manoeuvrability.svg" width="12" style="display:inline-block"/> - Manoeuvrability

Suggested starting setup for new players:

<img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/health.svg" width="12" style="display:inline-block"/> - 3

<img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/defense.svg" width="11.5" style="display:inline-block"/> - 3

<img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/attack.svg" width="14" style="display:inline-block"/> - 2

<img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/manoeuvrability.svg" width="12" style="display:inline-block"/> - 4

### Determining First Player:

The player who last saw a plane in real life goes first.

### Placing the Planes:

Each player places their plane on the playing area in turn. The plane should be placed within range 1 of the edge of the playing area, and no closer than the range ruler's length to another player.

### Game Rounds:

Each round consists of two stages: the Manoeuvre Stage and the Attack Stage.

The player who starts the round moves and attacks first. In the next round, the player to their left will start the round.

## Manoeuvre Stage:

- To move, place the manoeuvre template at the front of the plane token and move the plane to the other end of the template.
- Players can use manoeuvre templates up to the value of their <img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/manoeuvrability.svg" width="12" style="display:inline-block"/> score. For example, a player with <img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/manoeuvrability.svg" width="12" style="display:inline-block"/> 4 can execute 2 straight manoeuvres and 1 bank manoeuvre (1 + 1 + 2).
- Each player must complete at least one manoeuvre each round; otherwise, their plane will stall and plummet to the ground.
- If any part of a plane token goes off the board at the end of a manoeuvre, that plane is destroyed.

### Altitude:

Take advantage of the sky's vastness!

- At the start of the game, each player begins with 0 altitude tokens.
- Once per round during their manoeuvre stage, a player may spend 1 <img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/manoeuvrability.svg" width="12" style="display:inline-block"/> to Climb and add 1 altitude token beneath their plane.
- Players can gain a maximum of 1 altitude per round.
- If a player hasn't Climbed this round, they may Dive by removing any number of altitude tokens to gain an equal amount of <img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/manoeuvrability.svg" width="12" style="display:inline-block"/> this round.
- The maximum allowed altitude is 4.

### Split S

This manoeuvre prevents a pilot from being stuck when they are being tailed by an opponent.

**Cost:** 4 altitude
**Action:** Turn 180° after manoeuvre

## Attack Stage:

- The attacker declares which enemy plane they will attack.
- A player can only attack if the enemy plane is within range.
  - Use the range ruler to ensure both planes are within the designated distance from each other.
- The defender must also be within the attacker's firing arc, indicated by the 90° lines on the front of the token.
- The attacking player rolls a number of <img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/attack.svg" width="14" style="display:inline-block"/> dice equal to their Attack value.
- The defending player rolls a number of <img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/defense.svg" width="11.5" style="display:inline-block"/> dice equal to their Defense value.
- Each value of 4-6 rolled on the <img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/attack.svg" width="14" style="display:inline-block"/> dice counts as a **hit** and deals 1 damage.
- Each value of 4-6 rolled on the <img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/defense.svg" width="11.5" style="display:inline-block"/> dice counts as a **dodge** and cancels out a hit.
- Rolling a 6 results in a **critical hit** or a **vital dodge**, counting as 2 hits or dodges respectively.
- The defender loses <img class="small-icon" src="https://squadronleader.wollivan.dev/icons/health.svg" width="12" style="display:inline-block"/> equal to the uncanceled hits.

Example of the firing arc:

### Attack/Defense Bonuses:

Bonuses allow rerolling of dice. The number of dice rolled is determined by the Attack/Defense stats.

- The defender may reroll 1 die if they are within range 3 of the attacker.
- The attacker may reroll 1 die if the defender is within range 1.
- If the defender is within the attacker's forward firing guides, the attacker may reroll 1 die.
- An attacker or defender with higher altitude may reroll 1 die.
- When you destroy an enemy plane, you may reroll 1 die during your next attack.

## Next Round:

After the last player who can attack finishes their turn, a new round begins with the next starting player.
